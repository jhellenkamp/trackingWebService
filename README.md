trackingWebService is a service to provide multiuser ticketing including statistics to optimize.

## What it does:

trackingWebService implements a platform to create and work on tickets with different people. It's main functionality is to analyse user activities and block tickets.

## How it works:

The platform uses focus and input tracking to analyse user behavior. It blocks tickets when a user is working on it.
If a user is not active anymore it unblocks the ticket.
It also creates statistics to optimize ticket handling.

## What it uses:

Javascript, Ajax, REST Api, Ruby, Rails, sqlite3
